                I wouldn't click on this unless you have popups blocked. What does Ram Hog do? Well thats simple, Ram
                Hog has a script inside the page that opens 100 more tabs of the Ram Hog page. For Every page that the
                Ram Hogger opens, that page will also open 100 more, and so forth. While the Ram Hogger is doing this,
                the Ram Hogger could also opens up new windows if the user settings rather this, opening up to this tab.
                What this does is make it near impossible to stop the Ram Hogger when it starts unless you're expecting the
                outcome. If you're not, your device will crash fairly soon. Why does this happen? This is because Ram Hog opens
                itself multiple times executing the same script. This only works with popups blocks due to safety.

                Phantom Crashed looks like a regular page at first, but with a simple for loop this page will turn
                your browser unresponsive. This script will take up a bunch of your browsers resources and crash the
                browser while freezing and lagging out the victims computer. As soon as you open this page the script
                will execute, there will be no warning or required popupd in order to run the code. This script works
                by executing a for loop with a variable of i that initially equals 5, runs while i is greater than 3
                and will set i to be i + 1 each run. During this for loop the variable i will be logged in console. All of
                this overloads the computer due to improper formatting.
